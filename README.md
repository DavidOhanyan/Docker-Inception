## Introduction

Welcome to my System Administration project where I've set up a Docker infrastructure to enhance my knowledge of system administration using Docker. This project focuses on virtualizing various Docker images, each serving a specific purpose, all orchestrated within a virtual machine environment.

## General Guidelines

- This project has been carried out within a virtual machine environment.
- All configuration files are organized within the `srcs` folder.
- A `Makefile` has been provided at the root of the directory to automate the setup process using `docker-compose.yml`.
- Extensive reading and documentation study on Docker usage have been undertaken to accomplish this assignment effectively.

## Mandatory Part

I've successfully implemented the following components as per the mandatory requirements:

- **NGINX Docker Container**: Configured to serve as the entry point into the infrastructure via port 443, supporting TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3.
- **WordPress Docker Container**: Integrated with php-fpm and configured without nginx.
- **MariaDB Docker Container**: Set up as a dedicated database service.
- **Volumes**: Established volumes for WordPress database and website files.
- **Docker Network**: Established network connectivity between containers.
- **Automatic Restart**: Configured containers to restart in case of a crash.
- **Security Measures**: Avoided hacky patches and followed best practices for Dockerfile writing.
- **User Management**: Implemented user management within WordPress database, adhering to specified constraints.
- **Domain Configuration**: Configured domain name `login.42.fr` to point to the local IP address.

## Bonus Part

In addition to the mandatory requirements, I've accomplished the following bonus tasks:

- **Redis Cache for WordPress**: Implemented Redis cache for efficient cache management.
- **FTP Server Container**: Set up an FTP server container linked to the WordPress website volume.
- **Static Website**: Created a static website using a language other than PHP, serving as a showcase or resume site.
- **Adminer**: Configured Adminer for database management.
- **Additional Service**: Implemented an additional service tailored to specific needs, with justification provided.
